# Emojional
### FE1 Solo Challenge

## Purpose

This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where you are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum.

- Students should use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently. Google can (and probably should!) be used, but peers or mentors should not be consulted and any other code base should not be referenced.
- Instructors will be able to use your work, both completion of functionality and code quality, to determine where you stand and if you are behind for this point in the module, provide supports to intervene.

## Setup

- Fork this repo to your account
- Clone your copy of the repo down to your machine
- Read this README thoroughly, then begin working!

When you open the project in your text editor and the browser, you'll notice that the HTML and CSS have been written - your job is to implement the functionality with JavaScript! If you would like to change any class or ID names, be our guest.

## Submission

**At or before noon**, push your code to a GitHub repository and deploy to GH pages. Complete the provided submission form in your channel to share your work with us.

## Workflow

Commit at the end of each iteration (if not more frequently) so we can see the progression and timestamps of your work.

**Iteration 0:** MVP - one emotion

Only worry about one of the emoji buttons for now.
- When the user clicks that button, they should see one of the three responses associated with that button. 
- When the user clicks it again, they should see one of the three responses, potentially a different response than previous.

**Iteration 1:** All the Feels

Implement the same functionality you did on one button, on all three buttons. 

**Iteration 2:** Level Up

As a user, it may be a little confusing if you get the sme response twice in a row (you may wonder, did that "work"?). Write your code in a way that doesn't allow a user to get a "random" answer two times a row.

### Possible Responses

You are not required to use these specific phrases, we just provide them to save you time!

**Very Happy Emoji**
- "You go!"
- "Your smile just cheered me up!"
- "YAY!"

**Silly Emoji**
- "Interesting response"
- "Sounds ... good?"
- "Me too."

**Sad Emoji**
- "Do you want to talk?"
- "Keep your head up"
- "We can cry together!"
- "What can I do?"
