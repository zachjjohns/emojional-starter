# Emojional
### FE1 Solo Challenge

Your challenge is to recreate the functionality you see on this site: https://turingschool.github.io/emojional-js/

Here's an example of what it will look like and do:

## Setup
- Fork this repository to your GitHub account
- Clone your version of the repo down to your selected machine
- Read this README thoroughly, then begin working!

When you open the project in your text editor and the browser, you'll notice that the HTML and CSS have been written - your job is to implement the functionality with JavaScript! 

## Workflow

To keep up with good habits, it's recommended to make a branch for each iteration, with several commits per branch.

**Iteration 0:** MVP - one emotion

Only worry about _one_ of the emoji buttons for now.
- When the user clicks that button, they should see one of the three responses associated with that button. 
- When the user clicks it again, they should see one of the three responses, potentially a different response than previous.
- The user should **not** be able to identify a pattern in regards to the order they see the responses.

**Iteration 1:** All the Feels

Implement the same functionality you did on one button, but on all three buttons now. 

**Iteration 2:** Level Up

As a user, it may be a little confusing if you get the same response twice in a row (you may wonder, did that "work"?). Write your code in a way that doesn't allow a user to get a "random" answer two times a row. You may have noticed that the "example" site linked above does not have this functionality.

### Possible Responses

Possible reponses for each emoji are stored in an object in your JavaScript file. Feel free to change or add to this list if you'd like!
